# Itransition-Task3

This is a command-line Rock-Paper-Scissors that accepts an odd number of available moves and uses HMAC (Hash-based Message Authentication Code) to ensure the computer's fairness. The game allows players to check the HMAC key after making their move, ensuring that the computer did not change its decision after seeing the player's move.
